###  About Me
When I first heard about cybersecurity, I thought it was just about "hacking stuff". Now I’ve discovered it’s a whole world of protecting data, understanding digital threats, and staying one step ahead of cybercriminals. Every time I run a scan, analyze network traffic,  or catch my first alert in a security tool, I get a rush of excitement. It’s challenging, sometimes confusing but incredibly rewarding. I'm proud to be learning the skills that help keep people and systems safe.

### ✨ Fun Fact
I'm on a journey from zero to cyber hero. Currently breaking into the world of ethical hacking one tool at a time.I used to think cybersecurity was only for tech geniuses, but I’ve learned that curiosity and persistence matter just as much as coding skills. Every time I troubleshoot a command, decode a packet, or simulate a simple attack in my lab, I realize I’m building real-world skills. The learning curve is steep, but I’ve discovered that getting stuck is just part of the process and solving it feels like unlocking a secret level in a game.
